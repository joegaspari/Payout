## Problem Statement

Airbnb property managers face numerous challenges in their day-to-day operations, with invoicing being a critical pain point. Traditional manual methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, leading to delayed payments, disputes, and missed revenue opportunities. Moreover, managing multiple client properties and units can become overwhelming without a centralized system, resulting in disorganized information and difficulties in providing personalized services. The
absence of a unified platform for clients to access their property history creates transparency issues, affecting trust and client satisfaction. These challenges underscore the necessity for a sophisticated software solution that automates the invoicing process, streamlines property management, and empowers property managers to deliver exceptional customer experiences.

## Goals & Objectives

1. User-Centric Interface: Develop an intuitive, modern, and visually appealing interface that places user needs and ease of navigation at the forefront, enabling property managers and clients to interact seamlessly with the platform.
2. Automated Invoicing System: Implement a sophisticated and flexible system that automates invoice generation on specified dates (15th and 30th of every month) based on agreed-upon billing cycles. The system will facilitate personalized client interactions through customizable invoice templates, enabling managers to present a professional image.
3. Comprehensive Property and Unit Management: Enable property managers to effortlessly manage client properties and units, allowing them to add, edit, and archive properties with detailed attributes, such as location, capacity, amenities, and historical booking data.
4. Expense Tracking and Financial Insight: Offer a robust expense tracking mechanism, allowing property managers to efficiently monitor and store expense invoices and receipts. This functionality will provide valuable financial insights, ensuring better financial planning and optimized revenue management.
5. Invoice History and Client Access: Facilitate an organized and secure repository of past invoices, empowering property managers with easy access for reconciliation and historical analysis. Additionally, clients will have password-protected access to their full invoice history, fostering transparency and mutual trust.
6. Multi-Platform Accessibility: Develop a responsive and versatile platform that works seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, allowing property managers and clients to access essential information anytime, anywhere.
